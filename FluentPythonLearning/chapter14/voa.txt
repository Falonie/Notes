It will take billions of dollars and many years to rebuild the city, says the UN. In anticipation of Mosul's liberation, on July 5th, the United States announced it would provide an additional $150 million to help stabilize the areas in Iraq that had been held by ISIS, and on July 13th, it announced that it was giving an additional $119 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq.
As U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said, ¡°Under Iraqi leadership, the United States and our Coalition partners will continue to work closely with the UN to stabilize liberated areas throughout Mosul, supporting the return of displaced civilians to their homes.¡±
The stabilization program will help the people of liberated areas return to their homes and resume normal lives by restoring services such as water, electricity, sewage, health, and education. The United States is continuing to provide additional emergency food and nutrition assistance, hygiene kits, improved sanitation, emergency shelter, and protection for the Iraqi people.
